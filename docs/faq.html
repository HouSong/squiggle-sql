    <h1>Squiggle Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <p>This page attempts to address the more frequently asked questions about
    Squiggle.</p>

    <h2>How does Squiggle relate to JDBC?</h2>

    <p>Squiggle's only purpose is for performing text-manipulation of SQL. It
    does not use any of the JDBC classes. Typically you would use Squiggle to
    generate your statement, then pass it to JDBC for execution.</p>

    <h2>How does Squiggle compare to JDO, Hibernate, CMP, etc?</h2>

    <p>It doesn't. Squiggle is not a persistence layer. In most cases I would
    recommend using a persistence layer such as Hibernate or JDO, but there
    are some occassions where you just need to revert to a plain old SQL
    query.</p>

    <h2>Can I modify the Squiggle source code and use it in my own
    application.</h2>

    <p>Sure! Squiggle is open sourced under a BSD license. Please read the <a
    href="LICENSE.txt">license</a> thoroughly.</p>

    <h2>Does Squiggle support joins and subselects?</h2>

    <p>Yep.</p>

    <h2>Does Squiggle support INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statements?</h2>

    <p>Nope. Squiggle's purpose is for building SELECT statements only.
    However you can extend Squiggle to support custom needs if you want.</p>
